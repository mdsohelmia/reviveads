Release Notes: Revive Adserver 5.4.0
====================================

These release notes cover what's new, system requirements, download and
installation instructions, known issues and frequently asked questions for
Revive Adserver. Please read these notes before reporting any bugs.


What's New in Revive Adserver 5.4.0
-----------------------------------

 * Release date: April 14th, 2022


 Security Updates
 ----------------

 * Bcrypt is now used to store password hashes. The password of the admin user
   executing the upgrade is automatically re-hashed. All other users users
   will be sent an email and asked to reset their password upon login.

 * Minimum password length is now set to 12 characters. The default can
   be changed in the configuration file.

 * Added password strength indicator, based on MIT licensed Dropbox's zxcvbn
   library.

 * For more info: https://www.revive-adserver.com/faq/passwords-in-v5-4-0/

 New Features
 ------------

 * Added support for PHP 8.1.

 * Added support for WEBP format in image and HTML5 banners. 

 * Website invocation code generation now uses async tags.

 * Asynchronous tag now sends a custom "revive-<ID>-loaded" JS event when
   loading each banner and a "revive-<ID>-completed" event when all the
   positions on the page have been filled. This allows interaction and
   customisation, e.g. dynamically adding a class to all image banners.

 * Added welcome email for new users to prompt them to set up their own
   password.

 * Added password strength indicator during installation and password
   set up / recovery.

 * Added autocomplete attributes for username and password fields.

 * Tags are now generated using https by default, with the possibility
   to use plain http instead in the invocation code screens.

 * Added banner delivery setting to configure the "rel" HTML attribute
   for the click tracking links of image and text banners, defaulting
   to "noopener nofollow". The setting is also exposed in the newly
   added "{rel}" magic macro.

 * Added new maintenance screen to resend invitation emails to new users
   and password reset emails to users requiring the update to the new
   bcrypt password hash system.

 * Added missing linkUserToAdvertiserAccount, linkUserToTraffickerAccount and
   linkUserToManagerAccount methods to the v2 XML-RPC Api client library and
   fixed bugs related to (re)setting permissions through them.


 Bug Fixes
 ---------

 * Fixed prioritization issue when setting the "to_be_delivered" flag
   introduced in 5.3.0.

 * Fixed issue parsing and modifying "var clickTag = '';" in HTML5 banners
   when there is no whitespace around the equal sign.

 * Fixed issue allowing the installation to proceed when entering two non
   matching admin passwords, as long as the "Repeat password" field was
   not empty.

 * Password recovery e-mails were sent using the user name rather than the
   contact name in the To: header.

 * Password recovery landing screen is not longer english-only, but loads
   the user language instead.


 Non-Backwards Compatible Changes
 --------------------------------

 * XML-RPC API v1 is deprecated and might be removed in a future version.
   Please make sure v2 is used instead.

 * Legacy SPC invocation code has been deprecated: delivery will still
   function as usual, but the tags cannot be generated anymore.

 * Default banner image URL configuration has been deprecated, since it
   interferes with blank impressions. It is still working if already set, but
   is not displayed anymore in the settings UI and will be removed in a
   future release.

 * It is no longer possible to set the password when creating new users via
   the admin interface: a welcome email will be sent instead for them to set
   their new password. Users created via the API will receive the welcome
   email when no password is set.

 * Removed unmaintained Java XML-RPC API client and its supporting
   libraries.

Known Issues
------------

This list covers some of the known problems with Revive Adserver. Please read
this before reporting any new bugs.

 * The upgrade process may time out with very large databases. See
   https://www.revive-adserver.com/docs/faq for more information if you
   have a large database.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with MySQL, please note that MySQL 4.1 or
   higher is required. If you are using an older version of MySQL, you will
   need to update you database software before upgrading.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with PostgreSQL, please note that
   PostgreSQL 8.1 or higher is required. If you are using an older version of
   PostgreSQL, you will need to update your database software before
   upgrading.

 * Some of the PEAR libraries used are not compatible with database prefix
   names with double "_" characters (e.g. "rv__"). You should NOT install
   Revive Adserver with a prefix of this format.

 * Some users have reported issues of being logged out when viewing
   statistics. This can be worked around by ensuring that the timezone is
   correctly set in PHP.
